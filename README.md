Misc is a service designed to serve miscellaneous content - mostly raw HTML from 
the database. This is needed because editions need auxilliary files for things 
like descriptions of the project, etc. and to include these directly in the CMS 
is bad, because then you have data in two places and systems. Also Misc will 
(eventually) host other related services.
